# Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Description

This code predicts the price of a specific currency using linear regression algorithm and historical data. The goal of the project is to create a tool that can assist financial institutions and traders in making informed decisions about currency investments.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn.

2. Clone the repository or download the code as a zip file.

3. Run the code using the command: python3 price_prediction.py

4. The code will prompt you to enter the year for which you want to predict the price. 

5. The predicted price will be displayed on the screen.

6. The code also plots the scatter plot of the historical data and the trend line of the prediction

## Features

1. Currency price prediction: Utilizes linear regression algorithm to predict future currency prices based on historical data.

2. Data visualization: Provides visual representation of the predicted currency prices and historical data for easy analysis.

3. User-friendly interface: Allows for easy input of different currency and date ranges for prediction.

4. Data updating: Capability to update the model with new data for more accurate predictions.

## Data

The code uses a csv file 'Price.csv' as input data which should contain two columns 'year' and 'price' of the currency you want to predict the price.

## Note

The predictions are based on the historical data and linear regression algorithm, the predictions might not be accurate all the time.
